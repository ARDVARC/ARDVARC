Description: This is the CV node, it takes in the camera feed from ROS and annotates it for analysis, 
then publishes the annotated feed to the main state machine. It also performs calculations to 
determine the angular position of the ArUco markers. It will then publish the pointing vector 
to an appropriate ROS topic along with a recent sightings boolean to indicate if the marker has
been seen recently.

## Notes
- This node will be executed in parrallel with the main state machine.

## TODO create the ArUco marker detection and annotation function
## TODO create the pointing vector calculation function
## TODO create the recent sightings boolean function
## TODO Clean up the imports and improve the ArUco marker detection and annotation function
## TODO Ensure that coding is sufficiently modular and split into functions
